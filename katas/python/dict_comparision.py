# Comparrinf python dict

# first_dict = { "a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : "Nyquil"} 
# second_dict = { "a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : "Nyquil"}

# print(first_dict == second_dict)

## It doest matter with different order as well
first_dict = { "a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : "Nyquil"} 
second_dict = { "b" : 2, "a" : 1, "c" : "Nyquil"}

print(first_dict == second_dict)
